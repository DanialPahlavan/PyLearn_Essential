# Object-Oriented Programming in Python README

Welcome to the discussion on implementing classes in Python using object-oriented programming principles. This README provides an overview of potential properties and methods for classes representing fractions, time, and dates.

## Fraction Class

A class for fractions can be designed with the following properties and methods:

### Properties
- **Numerator**: The top part of the fraction.
- **Denominator**: The bottom part of the fraction, which cannot be zero.

### Methods
- **Addition**: Combines two fractions.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts one fraction from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two fractions.
- **Division**: Divides one fraction by another.
- **Simplify**: Reduces the fraction to its simplest form.
- **To Decimal**: Converts the fraction to a decimal number.
- **Display**: Prints the fraction in a readable format.

## Time Class

A class for time can encapsulate the following:

### Properties
- **Hours**: The hour component of the time.
- **Minutes**: The minute component.
- **Seconds**: The second component.

### Methods
- **Set Time**: Sets the time with given hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Add Time**: Adds a certain amount of time.
- **Subtract Time**: Subtracts a certain amount of time.
- **To Seconds**: Converts the time to total seconds.
- **From Seconds**: Sets the time based on a total number of seconds.
- **Display**: Shows the time in a human-readable format.

## Date Class

A class for dates can be structured with:

### Properties
- **Day**: The day of the month.
- **Month**: The month of the year.
- **Year**: The year.

### Methods
- **Set Date**: Sets the date with given day, month, and year.
- **Add Days**: Adds a number of days to the date.
- **Subtract Days**: Subtracts a number of days from the date.
- **Difference**: Calculates the difference between two dates.
- **Is Leap Year**: Checks if the year is a leap year.
- **Display**: Prints the date in a standard format.

Discussion on these topics is encouraged to explore various implementations and understand the concepts better. Additionally, obtaining the Intermediate Python certificate from SoloLearn can further enhance your understanding of Python and object-oriented programming.
