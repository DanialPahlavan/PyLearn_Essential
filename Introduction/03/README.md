# Python Programming Challenges

Welcome to our collection of Python programming challenges designed to test and improve your coding skills. This README provides an overview of each challenge and its objectives.

## Challenges Overview

- **Hangman Game Completion**: Implement the winning condition and solve the issue with uppercase character entries.
- **Unique Random Array Filler**: Fill an array of length `n` with non-repeating random numbers.
- **Array Sorting Checker**: Write a program to check if an array is sorted from smallest to largest.
- **Striped Snake Pattern**: Create a striped snake pattern of length `n`.
- **GCD Calculator**: Calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using a `for` loop.
- **LCM Calculator**: Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers using a `for` loop.
- **Word Counter**: Count the number of words in a sentence provided by the user.

## Detailed Challenge Descriptions

### Hangman Game Completion
**Objective**: Complete the Hangman game by implementing the winning condition. Ensure that uppercase character inputs are accepted (e.g., 'B' for 'book').

### Unique Random Array Filler
**Task**: Write a program that fills an array of length `n` with unique random numbers.
**Example**: `[2, 3, 6, 1, 0, 14, 16, 7]`

### Array Sorting Checker
**Objective**: Develop a program that receives an array from the user and checks whether the values are sorted in ascending order.
**Example**: `[1,2,4,6,7]` is sorted, `[8,5,4,1,6,7]` is not.

### Striped Snake Pattern
**Task**: Write a program that takes an integer `n` and draws a striped snake pattern of that length.
**Input**: `n = 9`
**Output**: `*#*#*#*#*`

### GCD Calculator
**Objective**: Create a program that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers provided by the user, using a `for` loop.

### LCM Calculator
**Task**: Write a program that calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers provided by the user, using a `for` loop.

### Word Counter
**Objective**: Develop a program that counts the total number of words in a sentence entered by the user.
**Input**: `python is a powerful programming language`
**Output**: `6`
