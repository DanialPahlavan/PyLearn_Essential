# Python Programming Challenges: Fun with Functions

Welcome to our Python programming challenges! This README outlines a series of tasks that will help you practice writing functions to perform various operations. Let's get started!

## Challenge Overview

1. **Chessboard Pattern Generator**: Write a function that prints a chessboard pattern of dimensions `n*m`.
2. **Multiplication Table Generator**: Create a function that prints a multiplication table of dimensions `n*m`.
3. **Diamond Pattern Printer**: Develop a function that prints a diamond pattern of size `n`.
4. **Pascal's Triangle Generator**: Write a function that calculates Pascal's Triangle up to the `n`th row and prints it.

## Detailed Challenge Descriptions

### Chessboard Pattern Generator
**Objective**: Write a function `print_chessboard(n, m)` that takes two parameters `n` (rows) and `m` (columns) and prints a chessboard pattern.
