## Question 1.1: Basic Calculator

**Features**:
- Square Root (`sqrt`)
- Trigonometric Functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `cot`)
- Factorial (`factorial`)

**Note**: Trigonometric functions in Python require angles in radians. Part of the challenge is to convert degrees to radians for these functions.

## Question 1.2: Triangle Feasibility Checker

**Task**: Write a program that determines the possibility of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides.

**Hint**: A triangle is valid if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the remaining side.

## Question 1.3: Student Academic Status Reporter

**Task**: Create a program that calculates a student's academic status based on their grades in three subjects.

**Categories**:
- Normal
- Privileged
- Conditional

## Question 1.4: BMI Calculator

**Objective**: Develop a program that calculates a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) and outputs a health message based on their BMI category.

**BMI Categories**:
- Underweight
- Normal weight
- Overweight
- Obesity (Class I, II, III)


## Level of Intensity :fire:
