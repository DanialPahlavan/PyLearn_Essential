## Detailed Challenge Descriptions

### QR Code Generator
**Objective**: Develop a Python script that prompts the user for their name and phone number and generates a corresponding QR Code.

### Factorial Number Checker
**Task**: Implement a function that checks whether a given number is a factorial of any integer. If it is, print 'yes'; otherwise, print 'no'.
**Example**:
- Input: `24`
- Output: `yes` (since \(24 = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 = 4!\))

### Instagram New Followers Finder
**Objective**: Alter the existing Instagram unfollow finder tool to highlight new followers instead, and rename it to 'Instagram New Followers Finder'.

### List Reverser
**Task**: Write a program that takes a list as input and returns it in reverse order.
**Example**:
- Input: `[2, 3, 6, 1, 0, 14, 16, 7]`
- Output: `[7, 16, 14, 0, 1, 6, 3, 2]`

### Duplicate Remover
**Objective**: Create a program that removes all duplicate elements from a list, preserving only unique items.
**Example**:
- Input: `[2, 3, 6, 7, 7, 14, 2, 7]`
- Output: `[3, 6, 14, 2, 7]`

### Python for Beginners Certificate
**Task**: Enroll in the 'Python for Beginners' course on SoloLearn, complete it, and share your certificate in the group.
