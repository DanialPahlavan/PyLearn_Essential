# Calculator Application 

Welcome to the **Calculator Application**! This simple calculator is built using **PySide6**, a Python binding for the Qt libraries. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing basic arithmetic operations and some additional mathematical functions. Please note that the code provided here is not a complete implementation.

## Features

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **Trigonometric Functions**:
   - Sine, cosine, tangent, and cotangent.

3. **Other Mathematical Functions**:
   - Square root, square, percentage, and logarithm.

4. **Sign Change**:
   - Ability to change the sign of a number.

5. **Clear Functionality**:
   - **AC (All Clear)**: Clears all input.
   - **CE (Clear Entry)**: Removes the last entered digit.

## Usage

1. Run the application by executing the Python script.
2. Use the number buttons to input digits.
3. Click on operator buttons to perform arithmetic operations.
4. Utilize additional function buttons for trigonometric functions, mathematical operations, and sign change.
5. Press the "=" button to get the result of the calculation.
6. Use **AC** to clear all input and **CE** to remove the last entered digit.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PySide6
- Qt libraries

Install PySide6 using pip:

```bash
pip install PySide6
```
